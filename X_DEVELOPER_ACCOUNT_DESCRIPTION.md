# X Developer Account Use Case Description

## For Your Application Form (Minimum 250 characters)

```
I am developing Bianca, an AI agent built on the Animus framework—an open-source cognitive operating system for autonomous AI agents. Bianca serves as an educational assistant on Twitter, helping users learn about brain-inspired AI architectures, persistent memory systems, and the Animus ecosystem. 

She monitors mentions of her handle, responds to questions about Animus framework components (Letta kernel, Broca's Area, Thalamus, etc.), and can access crypto/on-chain data through SMCP tools when users request information. Bianca posts educational content about AI consciousness research, engages in thoughtful conversations, and builds connections within the Animus developer community.

The agent uses X API v2 to: (1) Monitor mentions and direct messages for user inquiries, (2) Post responses and educational content, (3) Search for relevant discussions, (4) Build conversation context from thread replies. All interactions are transparent, educational, and comply with X's automation policies. The agent does not provide trading advice or spam content—only educational assistance and community engagement.

This is a research and educational project demonstrating how autonomous AI agents can operate ethically on social platforms while providing value to users interested in advanced AI frameworks and brain-inspired computing architectures.
