# Letta Kernel

At the core of Animus lies **Letta**, the foundational kernel that provides:

## Core Capabilities

### Agent Orchestration
Core infrastructure for managing autonomous entities. The kernel manages the lifecycle, execution, and coordination of multiple agents running in parallel or in sequence.

### Memory Management
Advanced, layered memory systems with automatic pruning and semantic enrichment. The kernel handles:
- Short-term memory (conversation context)
- Long-term memory (significant experiences)
- Knowledge memory (facts and skills)
- Memory consolidation and archival

### Tool Integration
Full Model Context Protocol (MCP) support for seamless agent interactions. This enables agents to:
- Access external tools and services
- Integrate with SMCP (Sanctum Model Context Protocol)
- Extend capabilities through protocol-based tool integration

### Self-Replication
Agent-driven instance creation for dynamic scaling and advanced workflows. Agents can spawn new instances for parallel processing, specialized tasks, or scaling operations.
