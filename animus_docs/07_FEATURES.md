# Key Features

Animus provides a comprehensive set of features for building and deploying autonomous AI agents:

## Core Features

### 🔌 Rich Connectivity
Native integration for robotics platforms, avatars, web apps, and IoT devices. Animus agents can operate across multiple platforms and interfaces seamlessly.

### 🧠 Model-Agnostic Core
Supports all major LLMs—OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Google, Mistral, and more. Switch between models or use multiple models simultaneously.

### 🖥️ Modern Web UI
Professional dashboard for managing agents, memory, and modules in real-time. Access the Agent Development Environment (ADE) through any web browser.

### 💬 Terminal TUI
Command-line interface for real-time agent chat, debugging, and orchestration. Perfect for developers who prefer terminal-based workflows.

### 🤖 Multi-Agent, Neuro-Inspired Design
Compose agents using modules that mirror cognitive brain regions—intuitive, powerful, and extensible. Each cognitive function maps to a specific brain region.

### 💾 Persistent, Multi-Layered Memory
Agents remember conversations, experiences, and knowledge—enabling real, evolving personalities. Memory persists across sessions, hardware, and environments.

### 🛡️ Privacy & Security by Default
Self-hosted, modular, and fully under your control—your data stays yours. No third-party data sharing, complete data sovereignty.

### 📦 Highly Extensible
Add new sensory modules, memory plugins, or research tools with a clean, plugin-driven system. Extend functionality without modifying core code.

### 📄 It Just Works
Smooth setup, rapid development, and a developer experience with actual brain cells. Get started quickly, iterate fast, and build sophisticated agents.
