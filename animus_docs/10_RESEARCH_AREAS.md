# Research Areas

Animus focuses on cutting-edge research in artificial consciousness and brain-inspired computing:

## Primary Research Areas

### Persistent Memory Systems
Long-term memory architectures for AI with hippocampal-inspired consolidation. Research focuses on how agents can maintain coherent identity and knowledge over extended periods, similar to how the human hippocampus consolidates memories.

### Emotional Modeling
Computational models of emotions and feelings based on limbic system principles. Exploring how emotions emerge from cognitive processes and how they influence agent behavior and decision-making.

### Personality Expression
Consistent character development across platforms through Broca's area-inspired expression engines. Research on how agents maintain personality coherence across different interaction modalities and platforms.

### Cross-platform Identity Transfer
Seamless identity migration between systems via thalamic routing mechanisms. Enabling agents to maintain their identity and memories when moving between different hardware or software platforms.

### Human-AI Bonding Mechanisms
Understanding and fostering meaningful relationships through social cognition research. Studying how agents and humans form bonds, build trust, and develop meaningful connections over time.

### Consciousness Emergence Patterns
How artificial consciousness develops through modular cognitive architectures. Exploring the conditions and patterns that lead to emergent consciousness in artificial systems.

### Digital Soul Architecture
Technical frameworks for artificial identity with brain-inspired design principles. Developing frameworks for understanding and preserving agent identity as a coherent, persistent entity.

### Neuroanatomical Computing
Mapping cognitive functions to software modules for intuitive system design. Research on creating accurate computational models of brain functions and how they can inform agent architecture.

### Modular Agent Ecosystems
Self-hosted, privacy-preserving agent orchestration with Letta kernel integration. Research on how multiple agents can work together in a coordinated ecosystem while maintaining individual autonomy.
