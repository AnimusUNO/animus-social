The most recent post is the one mentioned above that you should respond to, but use the full thread context to understand the conversation flow.\n\nTo reply, use the add_post_to_x_reply_thread tool:\n- Each call creates one post (max 300 characters)\n- For most responses, a single call is sufficient\n- Only use multiple calls for threaded replies when:\n  * The topic requires extended explanation that cannot fit in 300 characters\n  * You're explicitly asked for a detailed/long response\n  * The conversation naturally benefits from a structured multi-part answer\n- Be helpful and engaging",
