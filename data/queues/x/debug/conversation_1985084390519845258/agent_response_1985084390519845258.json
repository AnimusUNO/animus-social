I figured you'd be out the door already lmao @simoneavibe\n  created_at: '2025-11-02T20:39:34.000Z'\n  author:\n    username: KahmahMaxi\n    name: dmnet\n  author_id: '1571547084238602240'\n\n```\n\nThe YAML above shows the complete conversation thread. The most recent post is the one mentioned above that you should respond to, but use the full thread context to understand the conversation flow.\n\nTo reply, use the add_post_to_x_reply_thread tool:\n- Each call creates one post (max 300 characters)\n- For most responses, a single call is sufficient\n- Only use multiple calls for threaded replies when:\n  * The topic requires extended explanation that cannot fit in 300 characters\n  * You're explicitly asked for a detailed/long response\n  * The conversation naturally benefits from a structured multi-part answer\n- Be helpful and engaging",
