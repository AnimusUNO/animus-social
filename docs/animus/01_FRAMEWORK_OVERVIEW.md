# Animus Framework Overview

## What is Animus?

Animus is an open, extensible framework for designing and deploying LLM-driven physical agents with layered memory, persistent personality, and brain-inspired modularity. Whether you're building interactive robots, autonomous digital companions, or adaptive agents for smart devices, Animus provides the foundation for systems that feel genuinely alive.

It integrates a modular, neuro-inspired architecture, a robust CLI, and a developer-friendly interface to create agents that can learn, evolve, and maintain their own unique identities — across any embodiment, digital or physical.

## Why Animus?

> **Animus isn't just another AI framework—it's the only open platform designed around human-inspired cognition, persistent memory, and full data sovereignty.** Build agents that aren't disposable chatbots: Animus agents remember, adapt, and maintain identity across hardware, sessions, and environments. Modular neuro-inspired design means you can extend, swap, or fork any cognitive subsystem—no vendor lock-in, no black-box magic. Total control, true personality, real continuity—because your agents should be more than stateless parrots.
