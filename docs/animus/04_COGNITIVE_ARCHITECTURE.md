# Cognitive Architecture (Brain-Inspired Modules)

Animus uses a brain-inspired design methodology that mirrors human cognitive structures as faithfully as software allows. This approach ensures cognitive fidelity, clear division of concerns, and scalability of metaphor, making the system intuitive and extensible.

## Brain-Inspired Modules

### Broca's Area - Expression Engine

Coordinates multiple modalities to convey unified personality:

- **Speech Production**: Natural language communication and message multiplexing
- **Movement**: Physical gestures and behaviors
- **Behavior**: Adaptive responses to situations
- **Cross-platform consistency**: Recognizable character across different forms

Broca's Area ensures that agents maintain consistent personality and expression across all interaction modalities, whether text, voice, physical movement, or platform-specific behaviors.

### Thalamus - Sensory Processing

Acts as the central sensory relay and refinement hub:

- **Sensory Routing**: Intelligent filtering and routing of incoming data
- **Context Management**: Segment cleanup, tagging, and contextual organization
- **Real-time Processing**: High-performance reflex processing through sensory middleware
- **Advanced sensory input**: Sophisticated processing and context management

The Thalamus module handles all incoming sensory data (audio, visual, text, etc.), filters noise, routes information to appropriate cognitive subsystems, and manages context for real-time decision making.

### Cerebellum - Motor Control & Filtering

Manages reflexes and fine motor filtering:

- **Input Filtering**: Discards low-value signals and noise
- **Motor Coordination**: Fine-tuned behavioral responses
- **Reflex Processing**: Immediate, contextually appropriate reactions

The Cerebellum acts as the agent's reflex system, handling immediate responses and filtering out irrelevant information before it reaches higher cognitive functions.

### Hippocampus - Memory Architecture

Multi-tiered memory system for comprehensive experience management:

- **Short-term Memory**: Current conversations and immediate context
- **Long-term Memory**: Significant experiences and relationships
- **Knowledge Memory**: Facts, skills, and learned information
- **Memory Consolidation**: Automatic pruning, semantic enrichment, and archival storage

The Hippocampus manages the agent's memory systems, ensuring important experiences are retained while less significant information is archived or pruned. It handles memory consolidation, moving information from short-term to long-term storage when appropriate.

## Architecture Principles

This modular, neuro-inspired design means you can:
- Extend any cognitive subsystem
- Swap components for alternative implementations
- Fork and customize subsystems for specific use cases
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Scale individual components independently
