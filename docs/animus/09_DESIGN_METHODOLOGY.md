# Design Methodology

Animus adopts a **brain-inspired design methodology** that mirrors human cognitive structures as faithfully as software allows. This approach ensures cognitive fidelity, clear division of concerns, and scalability of metaphor, making the system intuitive and extensible.

## Neuroanatomical Naming Convention

### Agent Modules
Subsystems that model cognitive functions are named after neuroanatomical regions, making the system intuitive for developers familiar with brain science:

- **Broca's Area**: Expression and communication
- **Thalamus**: Sensory routing and processing
- **Cerebellum**: Motor control and reflexes
- **Hippocampus**: Memory management

### Global Modules
Core system components essential for operation are given technical names:

- **Letta**: The foundational kernel (orchestration, memory, tools)
- Other core infrastructure maintains technical naming

### AI Extensions
Components inherited from the broader AI ecosystem retain industry-standard names for familiarity and interoperability:

- Standard protocol names (MCP, HTTP, etc.)
- Industry-standard API conventions
- Familiar tool and service naming

### Personalities
Individual entities running on Animus are given mythic or literary names, emphasizing their unique identities:

- Examples: Bianca, and other agents with distinctive names
- Emphasizes that each agent is a unique entity, not just an instance

## Design Principles

This disciplined naming approach ensures that:
- The architecture remains legible and extensible
- There's a strong connection to the cognitive processes being modeled
- Developers familiar with neuroscience can easily understand the system
- The metaphor scales as new cognitive functions are added
