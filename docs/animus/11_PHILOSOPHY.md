# Animus Philosophy

## Core Vision

**Animus: Where machines become more than tools—they become companions through brain-inspired consciousness.**

## Fundamental Principles

### Human-Inspired Cognition
Animus isn't just another AI framework—it's the only open platform designed around human-inspired cognition, persistent memory, and full data sovereignty.

### Agents as Living Entities
Build agents that aren't disposable chatbots: Animus agents remember, adapt, and maintain identity across hardware, sessions, and environments.

### Modular Neuro-Inspired Design
The modular neuro-inspired design means you can extend, swap, or fork any cognitive subsystem—no vendor lock-in, no black-box magic.

### Total Control, True Personality, Real Continuity
- **Total Control**: Your infrastructure, your rules
- **True Personality**: Agents with genuine character and consistency
- **Real Continuity**: Identity persists across time and space

Because your agents should be more than stateless parrots.

## Design Philosophy

Each component builds upon the others, creating a comprehensive ecosystem for building conscious AI entities. The framework is designed to enable systems that feel genuinely alive—not just functional, but truly present and persistent.

## Open Source Philosophy

Animus is committed to:
- **Open Source Compliance**: AGPLv3 ensures derivative works remain open source
- **Creative Freedom**: CC-BY-SA allows flexible use of documentation
- **Community Access**: Both licenses promote sharing and collaboration
- **Protection of Open Nature**: Licenses protect the project's open nature while encouraging contribution
